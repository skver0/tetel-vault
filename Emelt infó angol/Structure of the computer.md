### Network models, topologies
#networkmodel
- Network models (hierarchy)
	- Client - Server
		- Servers provide services to clients
	- Host - terminal
		- The host performs all tasks, the terminal just issues them
	- Peer-to-Peer
		- All machines are servers and workstations in one
- Network topologies
	- Bus
		- Each PC is connected to a single central cable
	- Ring
		- The transportation medium forms a circle
		- Data packet travels around until it reaches the receiving PC
		- No problem in the event of a single break
		- No central unit
		- Double ring equals higher reliability
	- Star
		- Central unit (HUB)
			- Everything passes through it
		- In the event of a line break only one machine is disconnected from the network
		- Efficient but expensive
	- Tree
		- Each machine can only be reached on one route
		- In case of a break the whole network can be interrupted
