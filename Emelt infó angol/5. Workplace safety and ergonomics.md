### Healthy work environment design concepts

- legislations protect the health of those working in front of a screen in the EU
	- prevention
		- vision impairment 
		- mental load 
		- musculoskeletal involvement
	- provisions
		- 10-minute break every hour
		- maximum 6 hours in front of the screen
		- stable office chair
		- noiseless environment
		- equipment should not develop uncomfortable heat

### Work and health protection

- possible health complaints
	- hands
	- locomotor organs 
	- eyes
	- mental problems
- it is the employer's responsibility to prevent potential risk
- in general
	- the placement of the computer
		- bad posture
		- not enough space
		- bad lighting
	- solutions
		- movable monitor in all directions
		- leaving adequate space (in case of L shaped desks)
		- no reflective surfaces
- keyboard
	- there should be 8 to 10 cm space in front of the keyboard
- mouse
	- enough space for navigation
- space
	- restriction of personal space → stress
		- the table should be large enough for a flexible layout
		- laptop holder → must be adjustable
		- stable office chair → adjustable
		- on request a footrest shall be provided
- heating units
	- should not pollute the air
	- should not cool / heat the place too much
- lights
	- appropriate lighting and contrast, taking into account the nature of the work and the user
	- artificial light
		- glare and reflections must be prevented
			- good placement
			- good windows
			- good lighting devices
- monitor
	- CRT
		- radiates, flashes
	- LCD
		- doesn't radiate / flash
	- too much focus can make you blink less -> dry eyes
	- important
		- pay attention to resolution, font size
	    - sit facing the screen
		- look slightly down at the monitor
		- the monitor and the keyboard should not be at an angle
		- have adequate contrast

### Ergonomics of the computer and peripherals

- ergonomics: a discipline dealing with work processes and the optimal relationship between man and technical equipment
- there is now an increasing emphasis on humanizing the environment, because people are influenced by the environment
	- a poor working environment can reduce productivity by up to 25-30%
- the ergonomics of a programme
	- intutivity, clarity, manageability, communication, reliable operation
