# Information searching
---
### Searching strategies in library systems and electronic libraries

- Indirect informational tools (it tells which document answers our question)

##### **Bibliography**
- provides information on materials related to the topic/author
- discloses documents regardless of source origin
- the most significant are compiled by libraries

##### **Catalog**
- systematic listing of works in the library
- can be a volume or tag catalog
	- systems:
		- alphabetical / serial
			- list them in alphabetical order by the first word of the author's name (or, in the absence of a name, the title)
			- contains the document's data
		- objective
			- documents are sorted by content or topic
			- profession catalog
			- keyword catalog
	- the books details are recorded on a catalog sheet

##### **Cross-references**
- most libraries use this
- cross-references occurs in several places, classified by several criteria
	- ordering rules
		- author's works are titled alphabetically
		- publications containing several works of the author are sorted alphabetically
		- the author appears as a co-author
		- the author is a contributor to other publications
		- literature regarding the author

##### Electronic catalogs, databases
- bigger or even joint catalogs
- easier searchability
- examples:
	- MOKKA (Magyar Országos Közös Katalógus)
	- ODR (Országos Dokumentumellátási Rendszer)

### Navigation in libraries

##### Free shelf system
- any document can be publicly viewed, and held
- everything has its place
- materials are listed in alphabetical order by the first word of the author's name (or, in the absence of a name, the title)
- Cutter number (one letter then two decimal numbers, for accessibility)
- ETO-number for profession books

##### Searching for information
- execution
	- manually
		- card catalog
		- documents
		- with help of the librarian
	- computer
		- offline or online search
- search queries
	- conceptual
	- thematic or objective
	- individual search
	- chronological question
	- topographic or geographical question
- how can the librarian help
	- clarifies the issue
	- determines if you are in the right library
	- mark specialization
	- checking

### The algorithm of searching

- during the search (can be manually or with a computer), enter the value you are looking for that matches what you are looking for
- in case of a complicated search we use mathematical operations, thus manipulating the scope and result of the search
---
### One and two factor searching

- one factor
	- performed in one operation
	- usually not accurate
		- exception if you enter an exact ID
- two factor
	- the data set obtained in one factor is reduced to a smaller and smaller data set
---
### Searching on the internet, search engines
#searchengines
- the internet is a sequence of connected computers
- searching is needed for us to find the correct information
	- Google, Yahoo, Bing, Yandex, etc.

##### Searching strategies
- search engines use databases (titles, keywords, description, sitemap)
	- they monitor the web, find new websites
- thematic search
	- smaller data sets are more appropriate
		- by geographical location 
		- by multimedia type 
		- by document type
		- by specialization
	- not the most accurate system if we are looking for a specific thing
- keyword seach
	- bigger data sets are more appropriate
		- we search with specific keywords and/or phrases
		- more accurate phrase -> more accurate result
	- clarifier characters can be used
		- "", accurate expression
		- +, must include
		- -, must NOT include
		- `*`, character replacement
		- ~, synonym
		- logical connections
			- AND, OR, NOT, NEAR

### Computer catalog structure's specifics

- each item in the data file is stored once
	- it can be retrieved based on several criteria, but it is enough to edit it in one location
		- with card catalogs you have to edit it in multiple locations
- searching the database can be done with multiple fields
- at the end of a search, the computer outputs the number of hits and descriptions of those hits
	- we also receive information about the document's availability
		- if not, the computer can show the right library where the document is available
- some catalogs are also available on the internet

### Some computer catalogs

- SZIRÉN
	- contains the data of the Magyar Nemzeti Bibliográfia 
		- it adapts to the needs of the users
		- always updated
	- the main menu has plenty of options
		- mostly used by librarians, computer scientists
		- readers should learn about its search functions
			- quick search
				- by topic, author, co-authors, co-authors activity, author quality
				- by the exact title or a part of the title
				- by serial title
				- by library site
				- by publishing date
				- by publisher
				- by inventory number
- MOKKA (Magyar Országos Közös Katalógus)
	- operator: OSZK & Mokka egyesület
	- each partner library can upload their own catalogs (after conversion based on rules)
	- duplications are removed (with a program) → each thesis included only once
	- if the document is located in more than one location, the record contains the code for each location
