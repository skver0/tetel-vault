### Help books as sources of direct knowledge acquisition
- essential in obtaining information
- they already process known, published information

		- provides literature on the subject 
		- the concepts of a discipline / topic are processed in it
		- has an alphabetical index

		- lists words alphabetically
		- interpretive dictionary
			- explains words in the same language

### The concept and features of the non-printed document, comparison
- appearance
	- around the 19th to 20th century

	- they can be created and displayed most of the time with technical tools
	- sound material
		- disc - disc player
		- tape - recorder
		- CD - CD player
	- visual material
		- photo - film
			- development
				- film projector, slides, holograms
	- visual and sound material
		- audio film - movie projector + sound system
		- video film - TV
	- multimedia
		- magnetic, CD, DVD - computer, CD / DVD player

### The usage of manuals
- has to give an accurate answer to a question
- the choice of a medium depends on the level and how accurate, detailed an answer we want
- types of medium
	- printed
	- electronic
	- communication
- using mediums
	- the method selected within each medium must be examined
		- table of contents, preface, introduction, etc.
	- after the selected method is verified we start searching for the answer for our question
	- if you do not have a specific apparatus, they cannot be used for immediate information retrieval â†’ they must be completely read for an answer

### Types of informational tools
- library navigation tools to help the reader / user to find information / documents of interest
- 3 factors
	- the user
	- the information system
	- the document

- the information is always, but not limited to a specific library holding
- retrieval (passive) information, answers specific questions
- broadcast (active) information, offers its services in front of user needs
	- this is done with the help of bibliographies and reference sheets
- the main information tools of a library
	- free shelf system, manuals
	- bibliographies catalogs 
	- computer databases

### The concept and types of bibliography
 - systematic description and list of documents and information
 - its task is to take documents into account and to inform them of their existence and content
 - it must contain the bibliographic identification of the documents
 - bibliographic references are bound both formally and substantively

##### Breakdown of bibliographies by content
- general
	- a bibliography covering all areas, which in principle does not take the constraints of content and form into account 
	- usually its scope is limited to some degree (otherwise it would be impossible to compile), e.g. geographically, linguistically, periodically
- profession
	- it collects the literature of a discipline or subfield for professionals, those with increased interest

### Breakdown of bibliographies by depth of exploration
- complete
	- it collects the full literature on the subject
- assorted
	- sorted by some aspects of literature

### Breakdown of bibliographies by finding method
- independent
	- appears independently, no other text is added
- hidden
	- within the text of a document or in its notes
	- in the case of scientific works, it is essential to list the sources used
---
### The concept of retrospective and current bibliography
- retrospective
	- summary in nature
	- strives for completeness
- concurrent (continuous)
	- published regularly
	- it records works published between two literature
---
### Information catalog
- referential journal
	- gathers the most important and latest results of a given discipline
	- describes the literature
	- indicators make it easier to navigate between recommendations
- repertoire
	- processes material from one or more journals
	- retrospectively for several years
	- publishes an alphabetical and thematic list of published articles
- assorted catalog
	- publishers and book clubs often inform the public about a specific time period when they published their documents
- book and video recommendation
	- various program booklets, etc.
	- they are aimed at a wider audience, not practitioners in the field
- criticisms, reviews, recommendations
	- they are not bibliographies, but they help you find your way around the subject
	- these short articles summarize the material of a particular document
	- the features are presented and evaluated taking the user's perspective into account
---
### Aspects of source selection
- resource finding
	- it is useful to review secondary sources (catalogs, bibliographies)
	- moving backwards from the present on the subject
- critique of resources
	- the authenticity and value of the found resources must be checked
	- we have to look at the external and internal content cues and make decisions based on them
- value and authenticity of information
	- depends on the recipient and the freshness (online press preferred) 
	- credibility depends on its source (reliable)
- select sources
	- it is based on source criticism
	- the most important aspect is relevance (information noise, filtering out irrelevant results)
---
### Rules and ethical aspects of source designation
- resources may only be used in accordance with certain formal and ethical requirements (copyright law, etc.)
- formal requirements
	- publication of data on the sources used (bibliographic item, who, what, where, when, how much was published)
- ethical standards
	- the data should be noted that it is not our intellectual property
		- an exception when it comes to a well-known data or thought
	- we can just take a line of thought, or we can quote literally or even make it data-like
		- in all three cases, we must adhere to ethical requirements regarding the use of resources

### Principles for referring to Internet resources
- resources on the internet should also be cited
- references are very similar to bibliographic references
	- basic (available) bibliographic data on documents published on the internet must also be provided
	- in addition to the bibliographic reference, the path (URL) and the exact date of use are required
	- the date of use (last download) is important because the internet's materials can change, so we need to indicate when we refer to the document as it stands
