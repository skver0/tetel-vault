# Communication
---
Communication is a kind of information exchange, which always takes place through a signalling system. Such a signalling system is the human language. It can happen between people, machines or between people and machines.

- grouping
	-  by the number of communicators
		- interpersonal (between two people, e.g. discussion)
		- group communication (between a person and a group of people, e.g. written news or a lecture)
		- mass media (participants are not in the same time or place, e.g. advertisements)
	- by distance
		- direct (communication taking place in person)
		- indirect (participants are not in the same time or place, eg. chatting or calling on a phone)
	- by channels
		- verbal (Using spoken words)
		- non-verbal (Using gestures, body language or facial expressions)
	- by mutuality
		- one-sided (the receiver does not return any message)
		- mutual (communication is going back and forth, the sender and receiver can change roles)
	- by the relation of the participants
		- equal
		- unequal

### Communication model
![Model](https://i.imgur.com/Qhx6PLE.png)

In 1949, Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver published their communication model, which was later accepted as the basic communication structure of every human situation. Their aim was to make the transmission of messages over telephone wires as efficient as possible.

- sender
	- source of message, the one transferring the information
- encoding 
	- the sender encodes the message to get it suitable for transfer, encryption can be used
- channel
	- the medium how the information flows from sender to the receiver
- noise
	- noise can occur during the encoding, sending and decoding, it disrupts or clouds the message
- decoding
	- the message is being decoded with the same technology as the encoding, in case of encryption, the receiver must know the encryption key
- receiver 
	- receiver of the message

### Practical examples of the communication model
- one-sized, indirect (TV, radio)
	- message
		- show that being broadcasted
	- sender
		- narrator or newscaster in the studio
	- encoding
		- microphone and other devices in the studio
	- channel
		- electromagnetic field (radio waves)
	- noise
		- waves created by other devices
	- decoding
		- radio or TV antenna 
	- receiver
		- the person watching the TV or listening to the radio
- mutual, direct (discussion between two or more people)
	- message
		- the topic of the discussion (verbal)
		- the sender's body language or face expression (non-verbal)
	- sender/receiver
		- the participants of the discussion
	- encoding/decoding
		- the language that they are speaking, vocal and hearing organs
	- channel
		- air with soundwaves
	- noise
		- background noises

### Code, as the device of information broadcasting
- code: The form of information that the encoder creates, which conforms to the channel standard, and which is interpretable by the decoder.
- information: Information carried by a set of signals that represents new knowledge for a system. Its unit is 1 bit. 1 byte = 8 bits, the conversion from here on is 1024: KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB or the more commonly used 1000 conversion: KB (kilobyte), MB (megabyte), GB (gigabyte), TB (terabyte), PB (petabyte), EB (exabyte).

### Examples of channels
- signalling system for the transmission of electronic signals
- Local Area Network
- a specific radio frequency or frequency band
- cable, wire
- internet
	- IRC (Internet Relay Chat)
	- VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)
	- email
	- telnet, ssh
	- FTP (File Transport Protocol)
	- WWW (World Wide Web)
	- torrent

### Noise-canceling
- in case of analog signal: noise-canceling, insulation (e.g. soundproofing, electromagnetic shielding).
- in case of digital signal: insulation, correcting methods, parity bit (checkbit)

### Redundancy 
In information theory, redundancy is the use of more signals than necessary to convey a given piece of information. Thus, in a redundant medium, the amount of data is much larger than the amount of information. The greater the redundancy, the more reliably errors and data losses can be corrected. This can be reduced by data compression.
