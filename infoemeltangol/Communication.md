# Communication
---
Communication is a kind of information exchange, which always takes place through a signaling system. Such a signaling system is the human language. It can happen between people, machines, or anything that can understand each other.

- grouping
	-  by the number of communicators
		- interpersonal (between two people, e.g. discussion)
		- group communication (between a person and a group of people, e.g. written news or a lecture)
		- mass media (participants are not in the same time or place, e.g. advertisements)
	- by distance
		- direct (communication taking place in person)
		- indirect (participants are not in the same time or place, e.g. chatting or calling on a phone)
	- by channels
		- verbal (Using spoken words)
		- non-verbal (Using gestures, body language or facial expressions)
	- by mutuality
		- one-sided (the receiver does not return any message)
		- mutual (communication is going back and forth, the sender and receiver can change roles)
	- by the relation of the participants
		- equal
		- unequal

### Communication model
![Model](https://i.imgur.com/ukZVMLi.png)

In 1949, Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver published their communication model, which was later accepted as the basic communication structure of every human situation. Their aim was to make the transmission of messages over telephone wires as efficient as possible.

- sender
	- source of message, the one transferring the information
- encoding 
	- the sender encodes the message to get it suitable for transfer, encryption can be used
- channel
	- the medium how the information flows from sender to the receiver
- noise
	- noise can occur during the encoding, sending and decoding, it disrupts or clouds the message
- decoding
	- the message is being decoded with the same technology as the encoding, in case of encryption, the receiver must know the encryption key
- receiver 
	- receiver of the message

### Practical examples of the communication model
- one-sided, indirect (TV, radio)
	- message
		- show that being broadcasted
	- sender
		- narrator or newscaster in the studio
	- encoding
		- microphone and other devices in the studio
	- channel
		- electromagnetic field (radio waves)
	- noise
		- waves created by other devices
	- decoding
		- radio or TV antenna 
	- receiver
		- the person watching the TV or listening to the radio
- mutual, direct (discussion between two or more people)
	- message
		- the topic of the discussion (verbal)
		- the sender's body language or face expression (non-verbal)
	- sender/receiver
		- the participants of the discussion
	- encoding/decoding
		- the language that they are speaking, vocal and hearing organs
	- channel
		- air with soundwaves
	- noise
		- background noises

### Code, as the device of information broadcasting
- Code: The form of information that the encoder creates, which conforms to the channel standard, and which is interpretable by the decoder.
- Information: Information carried by a set of signals that represents new knowledge for a system. Its unit is 1 bit. 1 byte = 8 bits, the conversion from here on is 1024: KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB or the more commonly used 1000 conversion: KB (kilobyte), MB (megabyte), GB (gigabyte), TB (terabyte), PB (petabyte), EB (exabyte).

### Examples of channels
- signaling system for the transmission of electronic signals
- Local Area Network
- a specific radio frequency or frequency band
- cable, wire
- internet
	- IRC (Internet Relay Chat)
	- VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)
	- email
	- telnet, ssh
	- FTP (File Transport Protocol)
	- WWW (World Wide Web)
	- torrent

### Noise-canceling
- in case of analog signal: noise-canceling, insulation (e.g. soundproofing, electromagnetic shielding).
- in case of digital signal: insulation, correcting methods, parity bit (checkbit)

### Redundancy 
In information theory, redundancy is the use of more signals than necessary to convey a given piece of information. Thus, in a redundant medium, the amount of data is much larger than the amount of information. The greater the redundancy, the more reliably errors and data losses can be corrected. This can be reduced by data compression.

### Characterization of today's communication technologies and tools and how they fit into the communication model
- visual (e.g. : smoke signals, storm warning, sign language(for the deaf), traffic lights, road signs)
- verbal (e.g. : education, lecture)
- written (e.g. : mail pigeon, courier, leaflet, newspaper, post office)
- electronic (Morse-telegraph, telex, telephone, fax, computer networks, radio, TV, chat)
--- 
### Electronic communication and its tools 
Electronic communication is the method by which various types of information are transmitted at the speed of light in the form of electrical energy/signal. The original information (sound, light, mechanical energy...) must therefore always first be converted into electrical energy, which is then transmitted by wires, cables or electromagnetic waves in space. The receiver converts the signal back into its original form.
- Morse-telegraph, telex, telephone, fax, radio, TV
- internet (WAN)
	- IRC (Internet Relay Chat), e.g. chat
	- Internet telephony - VoIP
	- email
	- telnet, SSH
	- FTP
	- WWW (world, wide, web)
	- Torrent (peer-to-peer)

### The impact of communication tools on our daily lives and on information searching
Communication tools have had and continue to have a big impact on our daily lives. 
As they evolved, the speed of information acquisition accelerated, which means that the amount of information reaching one person increased, and dramatically at that. 
If you look back just a few tens of years, if you needed information, you had to go to the library, or ask somebody who apparently knows something about your issue. 
Nowadays, you have to reach into your pocket for your phone and just search for anything using your phone's browser. 
Without the development of communication tools, the modern world as we know it today would not exist. The emergence of the internet and its widespread use has also triggered changes within society. 
Today, anyone can find sites on the internet that match their interests, read portals, online newspapers and blogs, forums where they can talk to people with similar interests, express themselves, anywhere in the world.
The essence of Web 2.0 is interactivity, the emergence of social portals, the fact that the user also contributes to the content: commenting, writing articles (e.g. Wikipedia, Blogger, WordPress), sharing files (e.g. Facebook), images (Google Photos), videos (YouTube), their own writings, documents. 
With the spread of the Internet, it is now possible to watch movies on the computer, listen to music, and thousands of other ways to have fun, work, or even express yourself in the comfort of your home. Communication technologies such as the telephone, email, fax, communication programs and chatting have changed the way we meet people and how we socialize. The possibilities are almost endless. Also, the concept of virtual profile was born, the idea that anyone could impersonate anyone. 
Today we are so virtually invested, that we couldn't even imagine a world without our phones, computers, easy communications, easy spacial orientation using maps, like google, or Apple Maps etc.

### The existence and emergence of information systems in our daily lives (school, work, official business, leisure)
Modern technologies make our lives much easier. You only have to look at online shops (eBay, Amazon), electronic tax returns, online job applications, and a whole range of other official procedures. We can also download resources to help us with our studies, practice exercises, and we can also organize our leisure time more easily, for example by organizing online activities such as studying for exams, booking your accommodation, talk to friends about activities.
The internet is also essential for work in many places (online conferences, online meetings, home office etc.)
