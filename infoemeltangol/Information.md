### The development of informatics in summary????

- dimensions of transistors 90s
	- a transistor is 800 nm wide, in 2000 130 nm, in 2011 22 nm wide 
- due to the size of the atoms (0.1 nm) it cannot be reduced to infinity it is estimated that in 10-15 years the atomic size will reach the ceiling and new technology will be needed 
- fully self-driving cars may soon be on the market 
- 2015 CES - Nvidia: mobile chip, 1 terraflops (10 ^ 12 floating point operation / sec.) 10 years ago, it would have required a machine with a floor area of 150 m ^ 2

	- at first: sounds, drawings
- appearance of writing
	- written text recordable 
	- learning: because there is little literacy, oral recording, memory
- spread of book printing and writing
	- written record, readable
- nowadays
	- modern (mass) communication devices
		- first telegraph, then radio, TV, telephone
	- PC
		- initially an autonomous system
		- need data transfer for work efficiency -> floppy
		- later smaller networks
		- companies recognize that information exposed to larger networks is of advertising value-> growing networks, eventually the internet

#### The impact of local area networks
- the internet has fundamentally changed communication 
	- 60 years ago: meeting
	- 30 years ago: telephone booth 
	- 10 years ago: mobile call 
	- today: 
		- chat, VoIP, etc. -> fast communication 
		- Human connections have been pushed into the background, virtualized 
		- Virtual profiles (pseudo-profiles)

##### Mental and physical dangers of the use of devices
- most affected areas
	- eyes, ears, spine, shoulders, wrists, fingers, legs
	- both physical and nervous system effects are significant
- cause - effects
	- too much use - addiction (games, erotic content, etc.)

### Value and authenticity of information

- value, depends on: 
	- recipient, freshness (online press preferred) 
- credibility, depends on: 
	- source (reliable, from experts)

##### Purpose of hoax, recognition, adverse effects and processing of hoax
#hoax
- hoax: scam, rumor
- in many cases, handling hoaxes consumes more resources than viruses
- spread: thanks to users naivety (e.g. send this to 10 friends!)
- the goal of a hoax is usually spreading, but it can also be intended to cause harm

##### Legal and illegal forms of obtaining and publishing information
- publication 
	- legal: 
		- applicable laws (personal rights, intellectual property rights, patents, etc.) 
	- illegal: self-explanatory
- getting information 
	- legal: questionnaires, interviews, etc. 
	- Illegal: without knowledge of the source (keylogger, data theft, eavesdropping, etc.) + piracy

##### Networks and computers,  information / data protection, security questions
- computer 
	- firewall
		- provides protection when connected to a network 
	- virus protection, spyware and malware protection 
		- protection against unwanted software 
	- system updates: the use of an outdated system is a serious security problem 
- network 
	- filter machines
	- data traffic control 
- Information / data protection 
	- appropriate protocols (https, SSH-TLS, FTPS) 
	- encryption 
	- password protection (e.g. compression) 
	- storage encryption

##### Threats, attacks, and defenses to your computer

### Definition of computer viruses and pests, their properties
#viruses
- operation: when it runs, it attaches itself to programs and scripts, which it spreads as it runs, it works conditionally: e.g. it activates only after running x times 
- source: flash drives, emails, foreign / cracked programs, unreliable websites

##### Changes in the way how your computer works which can be used to suspect viruses
- unreasonable increasement of file size / unreasonable increase in used storage space
- appearance of foreign files
- runtime problems in programs 
- network management slows down, indicates an error 
- peripheral malfunction 
- general machine deceleration (overloading, etc.)

##### Some examples of the historical development of viruses
- 1990 Chameleon (first polymorph)
	- the code changes with each infection -> hard to detect
- 2000 ILoveYou
	- the most successful of all time, it traveled around the world in 4 hours
- 2004 Bagle, Netsky, Sasser worms

##### Explanation of development
- old viruses
	- releasing a virus -> the programmer might get a job at a company
- new viruses
	- silent viruses
		- data collection, botnet, etc.

##### Types of viruses, their effects
- file virus (oldest)
	- builds into executable files
	- only runs when the infected file is ran
	- conditional operation
		- destructive only when a bool is changed to true (date reached, ran x times, etc.)
- boot virus
	- writes itself to the boot sector of the disk
- macro virus
	- writes itself into the document's command list
- trojan
	- a program disguised as something else
- worm
	- distributes copies of itself on the network 
	- consumes memory and bandwidth
- spyware
	- data collection, key logging

##### Methods of defense
- infection of a clean computer
	- virus comes from an external source
	- solution
		- inbound traffic control
		- inspection of data carriers 
		- memory-resident virus shields 
			- checks boot sector, memory and running programs, notifies you if there is a problem 
		- firewall 
			- checks network traffic prohibits incoming data packets for which no request has been initiated 
			- monitors outgoing data packets 
		- antivirus
			- information about viruses is stored in a database 
			- checks programs, looks for virus characteristics (signature search) 
				- advantage
					- gives fast, reliable results 
				- disadvantage
					- it does not detect unknown viruses, as polymorphs are difficult to detect
					- must be updated regularly because of situations where the virus can activate itself 
			- heuristic search 
				- advantage
					- it can detect unknown viruses 
				- disadvantage 
					- slowness, false positives

##### Integrated anti-virus services
- boot check (boot sector, system files)
- auto startup with the system (virus shield)
- browser integration
- virus scan
	- can be started and scheduled
- email scan

##### Some examples of anti-virus programs
- Bitdefender
- Malwarebytes

	- protection: our data may only be processed for a specific purpose, for a specified period of time and only with our permission
- direct marketing 
	- we are the targets of a particular ad 
		- we are potential buyers based on our habits. 
		- data collection must comply with data protection and data collection policies

##### Protecting data on the Internet
- identification
- encryption 
- safe storage

##### Copyright and IT
- protection of intellectual property
	- a given program / image / work is legally protected
- copyrights
	- reproduction, publication, use and authorization of uses
- licensing
	- license agreement
		- specifies the permitted use
		- if you want to use a commercial application, you need to buy a license 
		- the software publisher authorizes us to use but not distributing 
		- the buyer confirms the existence of the license with the license agreement (also with an invoice, other contract) 
		- the license usually allows use on one machine

##### The concept and grouping of software according to licensing methods
- when interpreted as an instruction to be executed, it is necessary for the operation of the computer (to achieve the desired purpose), it does not belong to its physical components
- proprietary software
	- shareware
		- free software, free access 
		- mostly incomplete software 
		- most of the time they either ask to pay for the full / premium version or they can only be used for a limited time
		- distributable purpose: to showcase the program
	- trial
		- similar to shareware but not freely redistributable
	- demo
		- demonstration programs
		- their use is not limited, but there is usually a full version available for purchase
	- freeware
		- free to use and distribute 
		- the manufacturing company must be recognized as the creator 
		- it is forbidden to decrypt the source code or sell the software (as your own product)
	- adware
		- contains advertisements 
		- most of the time they are free, similar to shareware
	- public domain
		- offered by the programmer for any use 
		- often its source code is also available
- open source
	- free 
	- free to use, distribute 
	- source code is open 
	- freely modifiable

##### Software protection (tech. + Legal)
- legal protection 
	- copyright, contract 
	- the contract and legal framework must be accepted for use
- technical protection
	- unauthorized copying, access prevention
	- copy protection for CDs and DVDs (e.g. SecuROM)
