# Structure of the computer
---
### Neumann-principle (1946)
- has to be completely electronical, and has to have a central control system 
- has to process instructions one by one
- has to use binary number system 
- should store data and programs on internal memory and storage
- has to be Turing machine based
	- First Neumann computer: EDVAC
---
### Neumann like computer structure
- a CPU has to have 
	- Control Unit (CU)
	- Arithmetical and Logical Unit (ALU)
	- Register Block
	- Flash Memory - for cashing
	- Mathematical Coprocessor
- Memory
- storage
- Peripherals (I/O)
- PSU

### The structure of most computers today
- Today's machines are following the Neumann principles
	- Structure
		- Motherboard
			- CPU
			- RAM
			- GPU
			- Sound card
			- Networking card(LAN/WLAN)
		- Hard Drives
		- Peripherals
		- Power supply
- Main parts of todays computers in detail
	- **Peripherals**
		- Connectivity (I/O -> controlled by the I/O controller)
			- Extends the capabilities of the host machine 
			- Are optional in nature
			- General external connections(e.g. USB)
			- ie: printer, keyboard, mouse, headphones, monitor and a lot more
	- **CPU**
		- control unit - controls the data coming in and out of the CPU
		- ALU - data processing, calculations, etc.
		- Register 
			- is the fastest kind of memory (32/64 bit)
			- is temporary memory for the CPU
			- extremely low latency 
		- Bus system 
			- is responsible for connecting the CPU to the operational memory and other components like peripheral, drives, etc.
			-  contains:
				-  a Bus: 
					- which is a connection between components or devices connected to a computer
				- a Bus controller
					- which is controlling information between the CPU and all kinds of componets and devices.
			- bus types:
				- internal bus - connects internal components to the CPU
				- external bus - connects external devices to the CPU
				- paralell bus -  data is transported in several bits at a time
				- serial bus - data is transported one bit at a time
				- address bus - contains the location of different datas within the memory
				- data bus - transfers the data 
		- Cache 
			- small in capacity, but has extremely low latency, and is very fast
			- prefetches and feeds data to the CPU for processing.
		- Features: 
			- Clock speed (operation rate, Hz) 
			- Architecture 
				- 32/64 bit
				- arm/x86
			- Number of cores 
			- die size (in nano meters)
	- **storage devices**
		- **HDD**
			- Larger capacity (due to being developed much earlier)
			- slower speed (due to being mechanical)
			- more prone to vibrations, impacts
			- cheaper
			- stores bits
		- **SSD** 
			- faster storage than HDD (it doesn't have any moving part)
			- smaller storage size (due to being developed later)
			- uses semiconductors instead of a disc
			- not as prone to vibrations
			- more expensive
			- stores bits
	- **Memory**
		- Central storage of the computer
		- RAM (Random Access Memory)
			- Write/Read
			- Loses data if electricity flow is cut
			- speed is defined in "Megatransfers per second"
			- stores bits
		- ROM (Read-Only Memory)
			- Read only
			- used in largely in BIOS-es
			- PROM (programmable read-only memory) 
				- is a computer memory chip that can be programmed only once after it is created. 
				- Once the PROM is programmed, the information written is cannot be earased
			- Contents are retained even without power supply
		- SWAP (Virtual Memory)
			- Stored on the hard drives, used when memory is full
			- is much slower
	- Power supply (PSU)
		- gives all the components the power according to standard
		- converts AC DC power
	- Cooling 
		- water cooling
			- water block - connected to the cpu or gpu die
			- water pump circulates cooled water to the cpu and away the heated water
			- needs a radator with fans that push out the hot air and cools the water
		- air cooling 
			- cpu block with heatsink connected to the cpu, and most of the time a fan is pushing fresh air through the radiators
	- Housing
		-  i.e.: computer case, open bench, etc.

### Main peripherals and their characteristics
- Monitor
	- Standard video output
		- Size (inch)
		- Aspect ratio (ratio of the rows of pixels to the colums of pixels ie: 1080 : 1920 has a 16:9 aspect ratio)
		- Resolution (number of pixels - number of cols * rows)
		- Type 
			- CRT (Cathod Ray tube)
				-  A CRT monitor contains millions of tiny red, green, and blue phosphor dots that glow when struck by an electron beam that travels across the screen to create a visible image.
				- CRT display can have variable resolutions due it not having actual pixels
				- refreshrate of the display depends how fast the electron gun is and could be made higher by lowering the resolution
				- has to be warmed up before use (ie: the characteristic slow startup with high pitched noises)
				- were very big and heavy due the tech needing a big ray gun and a thick glass block to work
				- had deecent blacks
				- had great viewing angles
			- TFT (thin film transistor)
				-  utilizes an electrical charge that causes the liquid crystals to change their molecular structure creating different colors
				- usually has 7 layers sandwiched together
					- two polarizing filter
					- three color filters (red, green, and blue)
					- two aligning filter 
					+ + backlight which is usually a strong white or blue colored light
				- has poor contrast ratio
				- easy and cheap to mass produce
				- techology is small and flat
				- had poor black levels and contrast
				- not very good viewing angles
			- LCD (Liquid cristal display)
				- works similalry as TFT displays, ie: layered with polarizing and aligning filters, but instead of color filters it uses liquid cristals to produce color, which are changed by controlling the voltages, and illuminated by backlight.
				- has better black levels than tft
				- actualy pixels are used
				- refreshrate depends how fast the cristals can react to the change, which is given by the quality of the crystals
			- Plasma
				- uses small cells containing plasma, and ionized gases that respond to electric fields. The electric charge is then intersected with the gas and the plasma, thus changing the color in a very response, by the gas letting the plasma be stimulated in way it produces the desired colored lights.
				- had deeper blacks then other displays in it's prime time
				- uses a lot of power (a 50 inch plasma display could draw around 400 watts, which changes quite a bit depending on the brightness required for the scenes)
				- has very fast response time, and refreshrate
				- has better viewing angles than LCD 
				- are quite brighter than LCD
				- the plasma inside the display was very hot could even reach 1200 degrees, ie: the high power draw, and hot device

			-  they are connected by different outputs like:
				- HDMI
				- DVI
				- VGA
				- USB

### Network models, topologies
- ### Network models (hierarchy)
	- Client - Server

	- Host - terminal
		- The host performs all tasks, the terminal just issues them
	- Peer-to-Peer
		- All machines are servers and workstations in one
- ### Network topologies
	- Bus
		- Each PC is connected to a single central cable
	- Ring
		- The transportation medium forms a circle
		- Data packet travels around until it reaches the receiving PC
		- No problem in the event of a single break
		- No central unit
		- Double ring equals higher reliability
	- Star
		- Central unit (HUB)
			- Everything passes through it
		- In the event of a line break only one machine is disconnected from the network
		- Efficient but expensive
	- Tree
		- Each machine can only be reached on one route
		- In case of a break the whole network can be interrupted
